<b>Minimalist, Simple, Keyboard Centered and heavily based on SimpleFox. ðŸ¦Š</b>
</div>

![Preview Image showing both the one-line style and the style for smaller screensizes.](assets/preview.png)

Cascade is a Firefox Theme based on [SimpleFox](https://github.com/migueravila/SimpleFox).
This theme was known previously as "ag.proton"â€”but let's be honest: That sounds hella boring.
What you get is a really simple one-line layout that works well with the new Proton UI.

On larger window resolutions Cascade will have a oneline layout which displays the URL bar and tab list next to each other. Smaller resultions will stack both UI elements on top of each other for better readability.

Thank you [Nick](https://github.com/nicksundermeyer) for all the great suggestions for improvements! â™¡

## How to use a userChrome.css theme

1. Type `about:config` into your URL bar. Click on the **I accept the risk** button if you're shown a warning.
2. Seach for **`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`**, **`layers.acceleration.force-enabled`**, **`gfx.webrender.all`** and **`svg.context-properties.content.enabled`** and set them to **`true`**.
3. Go to your profile folder:
    - Linux: `$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/######.default-release/`
    - MacOS: `Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/######.default-release`
    - Windows: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\######.default-release`
4. If it doesn't exist already create a folder called `chrome`.
5. Copy your desired `userChrome.css` into that folder.
6. *optional* Customise everything to your liking.

## Customise Cascade to your liking

â€Ž
### Breakpoint

Edit the `min-width` value to change the breakpoint size on which Cascade will switch to the oneline layout.

```css
@media (min-width: 1000px) {
    
    [...]
    
}
```

â€Ž
### Colours

You can use your own colours for Cascade. To do so just edit the following block on top of the config section.
By default it will use a dark theme but colour suggestions for light theme users are given as well. Please also change Firefox' theme in your settings to make sure you get the best compatibility.

If you're using a custom colour scheme (e.g. [Firefox Color](https://color.firefox.com)) you can comment out the entire block to use the default colours provided by the Theme Addon.

```css
 :root {
    
    /*                   Dark       Light    */
    --window-colour:    #1E2021; /* #FAFAFC; */
    --secondary-colour: #191B1C; /* #EAEAEC; */

}
```
